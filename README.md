1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
When creating this project, I used one of the common methods when creating any project, to test small chunks of code often. This was helpful not only when making small changes to the code but also when building upon other designs. Testing the code after making changes keeps me  in the right track. The only downfall when adding new code,  the code needs to be complete or else the code will give you errors. Therefore, we can test small chunks if the chunks are complete. This tactic is common when developing code and will be useful in any future developments.
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
The programming classes from before had influence in this classes’ projects. Working with OpenGL and Visual Studios is novel, but the language follow a similar pattern to previous coding languages such as Python and Java. Iterating becomes helpful when developing any coding languages by speeding up the process, reducing the time needed to develop larger projects. 
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Learning a new language and using it in a different way helped solidify my understanding of computer science overall. I now have a better understanding of how computer graphics are created with the use of code. This new skill will be helpful if I am in need of developing or understanding computational graphics and visuals. Something as simple as knowing that computer graphic colors are created with the RGB color model. I believe to be a good computer scientist, being well rounded in all aspects of computer science is an advantage.
